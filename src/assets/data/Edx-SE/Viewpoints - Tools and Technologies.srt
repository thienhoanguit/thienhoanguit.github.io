Welcome to Insidersâ€™ Viewpoints: Tools and Technologies. In this video, we will hear

1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,120
from experts discussing their favorite tools and technologies for software engineering projects.

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,360
Our team uses Git and GitHub every single day for all of our projects.

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,280
We use it for tracking code. We use it for collaboration and we use it for tracking bugs,

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,680
features, and tasks for all of our projects.

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,760
I believe most open source projects are now using Git. Every project I've contributed to,

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,080
whether open source or closed has used it gets true value is most apparent when you're working

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,040
on a team with multiple people, at which point you'll be glad to have things like

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,040
feature branches and pull requests. But even if you are working on a project where you're

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,960
the sole committer, I recommend using Git, and in particular GitHub for the Community aspect

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,800
So if you are a front end developer, if you understand JavaScript and picking up

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:16,080
back in using a framework, like Node JS is not that much of a stretch, actually started building,

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,240
you know, static websites, and then slowly learned how to how to put in dynamic content

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,760
using JavaScript. And then I had to use Java, or PHP to build my back end systems in on the server.

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,080
For front end development, you're primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you're very

15
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,320
front end focused, you might want to try out an ID built for that specific purpose,

16
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,800
such as brackets if you want to keep things more general, I recommend VS. Code.

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,760
In either case, I recommend installing IDE extensions for automatic formatting and linting

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,480
of your code. By using prettier and eslint these will help you catch issues as early as possible

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,520
for back end development the tools are quite a bit more varied so it's

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,440
hard to give specific recommendations. But if you choose node JS, you'll be able to use some

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,040
of these same tools that I mentioned for front end development. Otherwise, I recommend just

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,920
looking into what IDE extensions are available and what linters and auto formatters are available

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,920
JavaScript is a very powerful language. It lets you do pretty much anything you can imagine,

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,520
including shooting yourself in the foot if you're not careful.

25
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,680
The practices I typically follow with JavaScript include proper scoping of variables and functions.

26
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,200
And writing unit and integration tests for my features.

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,600
React JS was developed at Facebook very popular. Angular is a framework operated

28
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,400
by Google that allows for development of single page applications. SPA's

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
jQuery is possibly the most popular and oldest library out there, created by John Resig in 2006,

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,080
and jQuery is frequently used with both Angular and React. Backbone is a lightweight JavaScript

31
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,360
library that is very popular in terms of back end languages and frameworks.

32
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,880
Node.js is an open source server side platform built on the Google Chrome JavaScript engine.

33
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,800
It uses an asynchronous single threaded architecture that allows it to serve a

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,560
very large number of concurrent connections. Flask is a framework used on Python that is popular with

35
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,720
Pythonistas and the Spring framework based on Java has been around for years and remains popular

36
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,840
We use React JavaScript framework it is better than Angular in terms of speed and efficiency.

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,960
React is easier to learn than other JavaScript frameworks, which makes its adoption in the

38
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:11,600
team easy. It also resolves, it also resolves the problems related to cross browser issues.

39
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,880
Another great feature of React is the use of JSX. JSX is helpful when working with UI

40
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,240
inside the JavaScript code. It helps react to show more useful error and warning messages.

41
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,920
My favorite front end JavaScript framework would be React JS, I love the whole component driven

42
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,200
design and architecture that you have then that you have to follow when you create

43
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,240
a React JS based application. I also like the idea of, you know,

44
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,800
props and states to hold your, the state of your application.

45
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,640
By using Express JS for back end development, we are able to scale applications quickly.

46
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,440
We can code both front end and back end with the help of JavaScript easily by using

47
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,760
Express JS. Express JS is supported with the Google V eight engine with the help of which

48
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,480
you will be able to get higher performance without any lag or error in processing.

49
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,760
It also supports the caching features, so you would not have to re execute the

50
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:24,800
codes again and again. Moreover, moreover, it will help web pages to load faster than ever

51
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,240
When working with Node.js, I'll, I'll give you two of my favorite

52
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,080
packages that I use on a daily basis. So first is making requests to web services.

53
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:44,000
I use a library like Axios, that helps me create these requests with the right headers, and also

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,520
provide me with callback functions and or promises to be able to handle the responses that come back.

55
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,840
My second package would be when I'm working with databases,

56
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,480
I'll use NPM packages, more likely than not to talk to an external database,

57
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,840
regardless of if it's, if it's a relational database, or a no SQL database.

58
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,880
So in writing JavaScript, I really like to take advantage of the features. And yes, six, because

59
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:20,320
it can make my code look cleaner, easier to read, and, and just more beautiful,

60
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:31,360
such as the arrow functions, or the dot dot dot operator. And so I encourage you to,

61
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:41,040
after learning JavaScript, dive into ESX a bit and have fun with it.
