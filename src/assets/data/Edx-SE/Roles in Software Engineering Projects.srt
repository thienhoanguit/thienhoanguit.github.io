Welcome to Roles in Software Engineering Projects.

1
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,900
After watching this video, you will be able to

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,050
list the common roles on a software engineering project,

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,160
describe each role, and explain the responsibilities of each role.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,870
There are several common roles on a software development project. And these roles can have

5
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:33,101
different names depending on the approach being used, such as Agile or waterfall. Sometimes

6
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:38,390
different companies have different names for similar jobs. But, not all projects will have

7
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,430
all these roles. The roles we will discuss in this video are

8
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,500
project manager or scrum master, stakeholder,

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,900
system or software architect, UX designer,

10
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,850
software developer, tester or QA engineer,

11
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:58,200
site reliability or Ops engineer, product manager or owner, and

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,460
technical writer or information developer. Now let’s describe each role and some of

13
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,720
the responsibilities for each job.

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,719
Traditional SDLC methods have project managers but in Agile the equivalent

15
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:15,889
role is called a Scrum master. A project manager makes sure

16
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:22,039
the project runs smoothly and facilitates communication about the project. The project

17
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:25,020
manager often deals with bigger picture issues such as:

18
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,489
Planning, scheduling, and budgeting; Allocating personnel and resources;

19
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:34,889
Executing the software plan; and Team communication.

20
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:40,189
In Agile, there is a Scrum master. Rather than focusing on planning, the Scrum master

21
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:45,560
is focused on ensuring team and individual success. Remember that the four

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,170
core Agile values prioritize people and communication over

23
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:55,919
process, and the Scrum master is responsible for facilitating that communication.

24
00:01:55,919 --> 00:02:00,380
The stakeholders are the people for whom the product is being designed.

25
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:06,979
They include individuals such as the customer, end-users, decision-makers, system administrators,

26
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:11,470
and other key personnel. The stakeholder is mainly responsible for

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:17,060
defining project requirements and providing feedback if the team members need clarification

28
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,150
on requirements or if a proposed solution cannot be solved as planned.

29
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,530
The stakeholders may also sometimes participate in beta testing and acceptance testing before

30
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,530
the software is released.

31
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,530
The system architect, designs and describes the architecture of

32
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,230
a project as well as communicates that architecture to team members.

33
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:43,140
They are sometimes also called a software architect or a solution architect.

34
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,250
They are responsible for designing the essential characteristics of

35
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,140
the inner structure and technical aspects of the software. The architect

36
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,100
provides technical support across the different stages

37
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,750
of the SDLC.

38
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,420
Note: software architecture will be discussed in further detail in another module.

39
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,170
UX means user experience. The goal of a UX designer is to balance making

40
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:13,340
the software intuitive but also as robust as it needs to be to address requirements.

41
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,950
They define how the software behaves from the user’s perspective.

42
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,200
The UX designer determines how the software communicates its functionality

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,870
to the end-user and how the end-user interacts with it.

44
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,960
Next, the developers write the code that powers the software.

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,970
Responsibilities include implementing the architecture laid out in

46
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,600
the design document, incorporating the requirements laid out in

47
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,540
the software requirements specification, and employing the UX requirements determined by

48
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,220
the UX designers.

49
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,050
Testers or QA engineers are in-charge of ensuring the quality of the product

50
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,890
and that the software solution meets customer requirements.

51
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,040
They are responsible for writing and executing test cases to identify

52
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,920
bugs or deficiencies and provide this feedback to the development teams.

53
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,220
A site reliability engineer, sometimes called an SRE or ops engineer,

54
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:17,840
bridges development and operation by combining software engineering expertise with IT systems

55
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,500
management. They track incidents and facilitate meetings

56
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,960
to discuss them. They also automate systems, procedures, and

57
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,509
processes; assist with trouble shooting; and

58
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:31,830
ensure reliability for the customer.

59
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,449
The product manager or product owner has the vision of what the product should look like.

60
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,110
They have an intimate understanding of the client’s requirements,

61
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,169
and the end-user’s needs. They are responsible for

62
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:47,580
leading development efforts to create the software and

63
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,080
for ensuring the product provides the value stakeholders are looking for.

64
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,699
Finally, the technical writer or information developer

65
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:00,410
writes documentation for the end-user. They write documentation on

66
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,669
technical material geared towards a non-technical audience. Not only does this documentation

67
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:12,099
help the end-user to use the software, but it also helps the customer so they can provide

68
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:17,479
timely feedback to the development teams. Technical writers may be asked to write

69
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,349
user manuals, reports,

70
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:23,159
white papers, and press releases.

71
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:28,129
In this video you learned that: There are a variety of job roles on a software

72
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:33,319
development project and each occupation has responsibilities unique

73
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,319
to each role.
