Hello and welcome to Software Documentation.

1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,350
After watching this video, you will be able to:

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,780
List documentation formats.

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,150
Compare and contrast product documentation to process documentation.

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,240
Describe the categories and types of documentation.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,090
And explain the purpose of standard operating procedures.

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,059
Software documentation is information about the software that describes what the product

7
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,940
is and how to use it. These can be

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,940
written,

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,940
video, or

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,379
graphical assets associated with a software product’s development and use.

11
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,660
Documentation can be in any of these three formats.

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,699
Documentation is an essential aspect of software engineering applicable across all the phases

13
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:54,979
of SDLC.

14
00:00:54,979 --> 00:01:00,179
Software Documentation can be written for different types of audiences – such as end

15
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:07,409
users, software developers, QA engineers, system administrators and other stakeholders.

16
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,850
Documentation can be divided into two categories, product and process.

17
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,200
Product documentation relates to the product’s functionality, whereas process documentation

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,440
describes how to complete a task.

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,010
Process documentation should provide the requirements for the quality implementation of a business

20
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,010
process.

21
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:33,390
Now, let’s discuss some specific types of product documentation.

22
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,340
There are many types of documentation. We will discuss five categories including

23
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,340
requirements,

24
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,340
design,

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,340
technical,

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,340
quality assurance,

27
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,270
and user documentation.

28
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,470
Requirements documentation is written during the planning phase of the SDLC and is intended

29
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:56,740
for the development team including the developers, architects, and QA personnel.

30
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,690
Requirements documentation describes the expected features and functionality of the software

31
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,690
system.

32
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:08,979
It includes the software requirements specifications, system requirement specifications, and user

33
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,870
acceptance specifications.

34
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,230
Design documentation is written by the software architects and the development team to explain

35
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,020
how the software will be built to meet the requirements.

36
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,040
It consists of both conceptual and technical design documents.

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,960
Technical documentation includes comments written in the code to help other developers

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,770
read the code to understand its behavior. It also may include working papers that explain

39
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:42,819
how the code works and documents that record engineers’ ideas and thoughts during project

40
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,550
implementation.

41
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:50,459
Quality assurance documentation includes all documents that pertain to a testing team’s

42
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,700
strategy, progress, and metrics.

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:00,490
Types of test documentation include test plans, test data, test scenarios, test cases, test

44
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:09,400
strategies, and traceability matrices. Traceability matrices map test cases to their requirements.

45
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,550
User documentation is intended for end-users and explains how to operate the software or

46
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,540
help them to install or troubleshoot the system.

47
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:25,349
End-user documentation includes frequently asked questions, installation and help guides,

48
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,960
tutorials, and user manuals.

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,880
Standard operating procedures, called SOPs, often accompany process documentation.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,890
Process documentation provides an overview of a process, but SOPs go through much greater

51
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:47,410
detail. The SOP is written documentation that explains step-by-step how to accomplish a

52
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:54,360
common, yet complex task that is organization specific. For example, checking in code using

53
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,780
a code repository is common knowledge for a software engineer.

54
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,780
However, an organization might have specific steps to follow for that organization in order

55
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,230
to get code merged into the main branch.

56
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:15,520
The SOP documentation explains those steps in detail. SOPs can be in the form of a

57
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,520
flowchart,

58
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,160
a hierarchical outline,

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,829
or step-by-step instructions.

60
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:28,720
Documentation, in any form, must be kept up to date. Take for instance online user manuals.

61
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,520
If a cloud-based application user interface changes, then the accompanying online documentation

62
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,800
must be updated accordingly. Businesses need to ensure they allot resources for this step.

63
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,330
With regards to the software development and the SDLC, updating documentation happens during

64
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,520
the maintenance phase.

65
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,400
Ideally, documentation should also be reviewed periodically to ensure its accuracy.

66
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,470
In this video you learned that:

67
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,130
Documentation comes in three formats: written, video, or graphical.

68
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,220
Process documentation describes how to complete a task.

69
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,120
Product documentation relates to how a product functions.

70
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,970
The types of product documentation include requirements, design, technical, QA, and user.

71
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:28,900
And SOPs are written instructions detailing an organization-specific procedure.
