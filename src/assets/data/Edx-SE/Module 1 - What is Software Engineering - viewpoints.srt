Welcome to Insidersâ€™ Viewpoints: What is software engineering? In this video,

1
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,730
we will hear from experts discussing software engineering.

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,220
I think software engineering is the process of using programming languages and engineering

3
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:26,070
principles to build products. These products could look like web apps, mobile apps, dekstop

4
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,150
apps, operating systems, or even networking systems. It is a skill that's integral to

5
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:37,700
the success of our modern society. Because without technology, we couldn't get a lot

6
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:44,840
of things done today. Within software engineering. It's a very broad term. And so within software

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,900
engineering, you have roles such as front end, back end security, mobile test, full

8
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:57,670
stack, DevOps, cloud data, and machine learning. And these are all different types of engineers

9
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,879
within software engineering.

10
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,309
I would define software engineering as building and improving software from anywhere from

11
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,759
design architecture to the user interface to fixing small bugs. So anything that falls

12
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:13,520
in that range, that's what software engineers or software engineers do

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:21,950
So software engineering, to me, I think really has to do with, I consider it a creative process.

14
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:30,039
And it's fundamentally is the practice of designing, envisioning implementing, and then

15
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:36,569
supporting and maintaining software through the full lifecycle of it. So not just writing

16
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:42,729
code, but, you know, thinking about the software you're building before you even written a

17
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:50,539
line of code, the the the journey from idea inception to, to actual implementation and

18
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:56,939
launching upset software and then maintaining it, improving it, supporting it, and potentially

19
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:04,209
evolving into something else. So it's very much a sort of creative and full, full lifecycle

20
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:06,649
end to end engineering process.

21
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:11,570
So I know in the United States, at least software engineering, software development programming

22
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:18,640
they all have, depending on who you ask, they mean very specific things or very hazy things

23
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,340
or very contradictory things. Or it's like why do we even have three different titles

24
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:31,660
for the same thing. I think of those titles is kind of all meaning the same thing.

25
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,660
RECORD NARRATION:

26
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,690
What s the difference between a software engineer and a developer?

27
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:42,840
Yeah, I think the difference for me, I consider engineering to be a little bit sort of broader

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,810
software engineer who broader than then development, I think development to me means is sort of

29
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,110
one part of the process. So I think one fundamental difference for me is I think software engineering

30
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,921
is beyond just writing code, which I think a developer often is handed a task to, to

31
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:03,310
write a piece of code, create a a module, piece of software, whatever term you want

32
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,820
to use, I think engineering involves sort of starting, you know, a very long time before

33
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,880
you even get to the development process and continues on beyond the time you would actually

34
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,280
take your code, deploy it. So this kind of goes into the full lifecycle.

35
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,990
In my opinion, there isn't A difference really. So for example, I was trained as a full stack

36
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:30,610
engineer or a full stack developer, but I was hired as a software engineer to work on

37
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,860
the front end of the company's application. So I think it's a matter of semantics. And

38
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,380
a lot of it, I think, is a lot of gatekeeping. To keep people who don't know anything about

39
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,310
us about the industry out. Somebody who has studied CS may argue differently from IBM

40
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,360
from ideal, but as a person with a non traditional path into the world of software engineering,

41
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,000
I only see it as like title changes and title differences. And I think it depends on what

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,910
company you work in, and what company you work for. Because at the end of the day, we're

43
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,960
all using the same tools and technology to get the product shipped to production

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,650
. I think that they are pretty similar roles. They are used interchangeably a lot, I think.

45
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:20,180
But I think the main difference is that software engineers are also responsible for the system

46
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:27,389
design and architecture as well as data, how it's received, used, and how it's disseminated.

47
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:32,499
Whereas software developers, I think, focus more on the building of apps and features.

48
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:38,469
So, in Canada, being a computer programmer, or a software developer is incredibly different

49
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:43,650
than being a computer engineer or a software engineer, where to be an engineer, it means

50
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,699
you've taken specific classes in like codes of ethics. And you're held to the same ethical

51
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:55,710
standards as a civil engineer or a mechanical engineer. And so depending on where you are,

52
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,999
the name, the titles can mean very different things. And I know for purposes of immigration,

53
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:06,270
the titles also can mean very specific things. And you have to be careful about like, what

54
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:14,360
it is that you put down. But in job descriptions, I kind of see them all used interchangeably,

55
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,809
and I tend to just kind of think of them all as the same thing.

56
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:23,740
The, you know, it's much of a more of a longer time horizon, I think, in front in terms of

57
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,590
engineering versus development. I think there's a lot more considerations and hats you need

58
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,960
to put on throughout the software engineering lifecycle versus the kind of more narrowly

59
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,530
scoped development cycle.
