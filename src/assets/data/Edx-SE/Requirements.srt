00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,840
Welcome to Requirements.

1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,280
After watching this video, you will be able to:

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,720
Describe the steps of the requirement gathering process.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,000
Explain the purpose of a User Requirement Specification, or URS, document.

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,160
Explain the purpose of a Software Requirement Specification, or SRS, document, and

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,120
Explain the purpose of a System Requirement Specification, or SysRS, document

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,240
Requirement gathering is a six-step process of defining a problem to

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,680
be solved and documenting how to go about solving that problem. These steps include:

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,360
identifying stakeholders,

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,520
establishing goals and objectives,

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,160
eliciting requirements from the stakeholders,

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,000
documenting the requirements,

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,800
analyzing and confirming the requirements, and

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,840
prioritizing.

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,600
Generally, the stakeholders work for the organization that

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,080
requests the development of the software product.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,600
Key personnel from the organization may include

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,640
decision-makers,

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,520
end-users,

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,960
system administrators,

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,840
engineering,

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,560
marketing,

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,040
sales,

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,800
and customer support personnel.

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,280
It is good to have a representative from every group that the product affects.

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,440
The goals of the product should be clearly defined.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,720
Goals are broad, long-term achievable outcomes.

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,240
Goals can include customer outcomes and business goals.

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,160
Next, objectives should be identified. Objectives are more specific than goals

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,320
and they are actionable and measurable actions that achieve the stated goals.

30
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,920
The next three steps, eliciting, documenting,

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,600
and requirement confirmation are usually completed iteratively.

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,480
Elicitation can be accomplished through

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,200
surveys,

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,080
questionnaires,

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,000
and interviews. As the requirements emerge, they should be

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,320
documented and checked to ensure they

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,400
align with the goals and objectives.

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,080
Documented requirements should be easily understood by stakeholders and the project team.

39
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,720
In order to confirm the requirements,

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,440
they should be analyzed to ensure consistency,

41
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,080
clarity,

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,200
and completeness. After analysis, the requirements should be shared with

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
and approved by the stakeholders.

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,800
After confirmation, requirements should be prioritized. Labels such as

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,520
“must-have,”

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,560
“highly desired,”

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,480
and “nice to have” are helpful. If possible, order the requirements within those categories.

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,320
Typically, there may be three documents that result from the requirements gathering process:

49
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,160
software requirements specification, or SRS,

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,520
user requirements specification, or URS,

51
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,400
and system requirements specification,

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,880
or SysRS. The most common of these is the software requirements specification.

53
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,320
The software requirements specification, or SRS,

54
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,720
is a document that captures the functionalities that the software should perform

55
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,960
and also establishes benchmarks or service levels for its performance.

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
Parts of an SRS include:

57
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,440
A purpose statement that contains

58
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,600
the intended use of the SRS,

59
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,640
its audience and

60
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,440
scope,

61
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,000
constraints, assumptions and dependencies, and

62
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,840
requirements, which can be sorted into four categories:

63
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
Functional requirements

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,760
External Interface requirements

65
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,640
System Features

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,600
Non-functional requirements

67
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,360
The product’s purpose describes

68
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,000
who will have access to the SRS and

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,600
how they should use it.

70
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,720
The scope describes

71
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,400
the benefits of the software,

72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,440
its goals, and

73
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,160
objectives.

74
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,240
The second part of the SRS should detail constraints, assumptions, and dependencies.

75
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,520
Constraints describe how the product must operate under given conditions that may

76
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,600
limit options in the design phase such as conformation to standards or hardware limitations.

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,960
Assumptions may include things like a required

78
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,040
operating system or hardware that is needed by the software to function.

79
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,200
Dependencies on other software products should also be noted.

80
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,680
Requirements can be classified into four categories.

81
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,320
Functional requirements are those that cover the functionalities of the software.

82
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,800
External requirements are the requirements that address the behavior of the software

83
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:25,280
in relation to external entities such as users and interactions with other hardware or software.

84
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,680
System features are a subset of functional requirements.

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,560
These are required features for the system to function.

86
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,760
There are also non-functional requirements such as specifying performance,

87
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,480
safety, security, and quality standards.

88
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,120
User requirements describe the business need and expectations

89
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,080
of the end-users from the software system.

90
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,600
The user requirements are written as “user stories” or

91
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,480
“use cases” that answer three questions:

92
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,920
Who is the user?

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,400
What is the function that needs to be performed?

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,440
Why does the user want this functionality?

95
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,160
User acceptance testing determines if these requirements have been met.

96
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,960
Often though, the user requirements and software requirements are combined

97
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,600
into a single SRS document. The SRS details the expectations of the software system.

98
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,760
The System Requirement Specification document, or SysRS, to differentiate it from

99
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,840
the SRS, clearly outlines the requirements of an entire system. The system requirement

100
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,200
specification is often used interchangeably with software requirement specification,

101
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,440
but the SysRS is actually broader in scope than the SRS.

102
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,480
Many software projects develop an SRS rather than a SysRS.

103
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,960
The SysRS contains

104
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,400
system capabilities,

105
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,560
interfaces, and user characteristics. It also may include

106
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,920
policy requirements,

107
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,280
regulation requirements,

108
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,800
personnel requirements,

109
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,240
performance requirements,

110
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,600
security requirements,

111
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,520
and system acceptance criteria.

112
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,000
It also outlines expectations of the hardware needed for the system

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
in addition to software requirements.

114
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
In this video you learned that:

115
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,480
The requirement gathering process entails identifying stakeholders, establishing

116
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,240
goals and objectives, and eliciting, documenting, confirming, and then prioritizing requirements.

117
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,400
The SRS documents functional, external, system, and non-functional requirements.

118
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,600
The URS documents user stories.

119
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,760
And finally, the SysRS documents system capabilities and acceptance criteria,

120
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:47,840
and policy, regulation, personnel, performance, security, and hardware requirements.
