Welcome to Teamwork and Squads.

1
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,880
After watching this video, you will be able to define teamwork and describe the advantages

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,880
of collaboration in software engineering and describe squads.

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,760
By definition, a team is a group of people working together towards a common aim.

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,329
Within a team, you’ll find a range of different people with different skills, experience,

5
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,760
and talents.

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,551
Each person can give their attention and effort to the things that they are good at, and by

7
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:42,520
working alongside others on tasks outside their current repertoire, they can expand

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,370
their skillset.

9
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,400
Working in a team promotes creativity.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,640
Collaborating with others gives you the opportunity to discuss ideas and challenge one another’s

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,770
thinking about a subject.

12
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:01,019
Good teamwork is empowering: positive attitudes and behaviors can impact the rest of the team

13
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,780
and create positive results.

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,570
Working well as a team doesn’t always come naturally, but there are some things you can

15
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,290
consider to help your team succeed.

16
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,400
Each member needs to trust and respect the other members of the team.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,400
This generally comes with time, but depends on all of the members contributing equitably.

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,369
Defining and agreeing on goals for a project is essential so that the whole team knows

19
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,320
what they are working towards.

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,579
And you also need to define and agree on roles to avoid any duplication of effort or missed

21
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:36,100
tasks.

22
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,380
Working with each members strengths is important to make the most of the talent within your

23
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,380
team,

24
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,290
as is celebrating success and analysing problems.

25
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,420
Communication is vital in a team environment.

26
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,979
Ensure that you choose a method that works for everyone so you know that the whole team

27
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,799
is seeing and responding to information.

28
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,180
So, what does teamwork look like in software engineering?

29
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,600
Teams often start projects with a kick-off meeting where they plan how they will complete

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,770
the project, assign tasks, and agree on goals.

31
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,230
Throughout the lifetime of a project, you’re likely to have whole team and/or sub team

32
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,500
meetings to review progress and plans.

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,950
Design and code reviews can be requested at the team level and undertaken by whoever has

34
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,620
availability at that point in time.

35
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,930
Team members might present walkthroughs of their sections of responsibility to the rest

36
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,880
of team so that the whole team has oversight of all parts of the project.

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,140
And, key team members will likely present walkthroughs to stakeholders at various times

38
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,170
during the project.

39
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,060
When a project is complete, retrospective meetings may be held to review what went well

40
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,540
and what could be improved in future projects.

41
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,470
You may have a mentor who may or may not be in your current project team.

42
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,110
You might also be asked to be a mentor.

43
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,160
Sometimes team mentoring is used so everyone can learn from each other.

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:09,400
Some groups also have teams working on internal projects such as defining coding standards,

45
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,860
maintaining or updating legacy cross-project code, or reviewing potential new software

46
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,650
for usefulness to the team.

47
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,450
Good teamwork can bring many benefits to a project.

48
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,690
Working alongside others can encourage creativity and enable you to take advantage of each person’s

49
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,989
strengths while also allowing them to gain knowledge and skills from other members of

50
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:33,370
the team.

51
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,780
When working as part of a team, software engineers are more likely to adhere to corporate coding

52
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,540
standards and regularly document their code.

53
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,440
The additional accountability that teamwork creates results in better quality code, fewer

54
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,080
bugs, and more maintainable code.

55
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,150
From a software engineer’s point of view, working as a team can reduce stress because

56
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,000
there’s always someone to turn to and get help from.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,690
And having someone to discuss problems with can help you to increase your understanding

58
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,159
and resolve more issues by yourself.

59
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:15,110
By working in a team, each member has a greater idea of the bigger picture, resulting in a

60
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,519
more coherent overall solution.

61
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,130
Some organizations that follow Agile development methodologies may call a team a squad.

62
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,350
Typically, a squad is a small team of up to 10 developers.

63
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,160
It is likely to consist of:

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,730
A squad leader who acts as the anchor developer and coach for the squad.

65
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:41,030
And a few software engineers who develop and implement the product features and test cases.

66
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,750
It may also include one or two user experience developers or designers.

67
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,870
In some squads the developers may work together in pairs to practice pair programming.

68
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,000
You’ll learn more about pair programming in another video.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,530
In this video, you learned that:

70
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,300
Software engineering teams meet regularly throughout the duration of a project.

71
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:12,250
Good teamwork encourages creativity, shares knowledge, and results in better quality code.

72
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,280
Squads are small teams used in agile development.
