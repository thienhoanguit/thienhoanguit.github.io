1
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,340
Internet websites offer lots of different services, one of the most popular being online

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,540
shopping.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,270
When you explore an online shopping website, navigating through pages, choosing different

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,460
product categories, or comparing products, you are interacting with the front-end of

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,920
a website.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,710
Let us see how the front-end of a website is developed by front-end developers.

7
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,170
For this, we need to understand how a website is made.

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,050
To create a website, web developers usually use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading

9
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:51,789
Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. These languages are designed to work in conjunction with each

10
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:52,940
other.

11
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,190
HTML is used to create the physical structure of a website.

12
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:04,210
The physical structure contains elements such as text, links, images/videos, page dividers

13
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,590
and buttons.

14
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:11,840
The HTML code ensures a proper formatting of all text and image elements so that browsers

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,730
display the page consistently.

16
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,200
The backend developer codes the structure of the website.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,940
A website is like a house which has only been constructed.

18
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:27,440
Just like we need interior designers to add style to a space, we need front-end developers

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,790
to add the necessary glamor and appeal to a website.

20
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,490
When you order products from any website, you realize that the pages have a pleasing

21
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,600
font, attractive colors, and are easy to navigate.

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,030
Developers use CSS to create stylish websites.

23
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:52,760
CSS provides front-end developers with a standard method to define, apply, and manage different

24
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,690
sets of style characteristics for a website and each of its components.

25
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:04,380
CSS ensures uniformity in look and feel, style, colors, fonts, designs and layouts.

26
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:11,880
So, HTML is used to create the structure and CSS is used to design it and make it appealing.

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:18,800
CSS is also used to create websites that have cross browser compatibility which means that

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,030
they are compatible with multiple browsers and multiple devices such as PC, mobile devices,

29
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,569
iPads etc.

30
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:33,650
Online shopping websites are intuitive, interactive and quick to load. This is where

31
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,530
JavaScript comes into the picture.

32
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,780
JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that is used in conjunction with

33
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,840
HTML and CSS to add interactivity to a website.

34
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:54,060
For example, you use HTML to add a login button to a page, and CSS to style that button.

35
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,550
You then use JavaScript to add log-in functionality to that button.

36
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:08,170
A new front-end development language is Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (SASS) called SAAS.

37
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,260
It is an extension of CSS that is compatible with all versions of CSS.

38
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,549
SASS enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, and inline imports to keep things

39
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:21,900
organized.

40
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,690
SAAS allows you to create style sheets faster and more easily.

41
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:33,590
Another language that is being used now is Learner Style Sheets (LESS) or LESS.

42
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,470
LESS enhances CSS, adding more styles and functions. It is backwards compatible with

43
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,819
CSS.

44
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:48,109
Less.js is a JavaScript tool that converts the LESS styles to CSS styles.

45
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:53,900
Using all these languages, websites are designed as reactive and responsive.

46
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,340
Reactive or adaptive websites display the version of the website designed for a specific

47
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:00,580
screen size.

48
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,750
For example, a website can provide more information if opened on a PC than when opened on a mobile

49
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,300
device.

50
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,800
Responsive design of a website means that it will automatically resize to the device

51
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:15,829
it is being accessed from.

52
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:20,829
For example, if you open up a products website on your mobile device, it will adapt itself

53
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:26,360
to the small size of the screen and still show you all the features.

54
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,460
A JavaScript framework is an application framework that is written in JavaScript.

55
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,490
Programmers can manipulate the different functions, use them wherever required and can create

56
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,030
device responsive applications.

57
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,740
A few examples of several frameworks being used are:

58
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,580
Angular framework: an open-source framework and is being maintained by Google.

59
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:54,530
Angular frameworks allow websites to render the HTML pages quickly and efficiently.

60
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,080
It has built-in tools for routing and form validation.

61
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,400
React.js has been developed and maintained by Facebook.

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,419
It is a JavaScript library that builds and renders components for a web page.

63
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:11,280
It is not a complete suite of tools.

64
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,080
For example, routing is not a part of this framework and will need to be added using

65
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,259
a third-party tool.

66
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,820
React.js only helps build and drop components into a page.

67
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,259
Vue.js is maintained by the community and its main focus is the view layer which includes

68
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:33,810
user interface, buttons, and visual components.

69
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,919
It is flexible, scalable and integrates well with other frameworks.

70
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:45,100
It is very adaptable. It can be a library, or it can be the framework.

71
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,039
The task of a front-end developer evolves continuously.

72
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,800
The technologies are upgraded constantly and so front-end developers needs to keep

73
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,629
upgrading the websites that they create.

74
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:01,759
The websites that they create should work in multiple browsers, multiple operating systems

75
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,020
and multiple devices.
