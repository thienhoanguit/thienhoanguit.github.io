Welcome to Software Versions

1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,599
After watching this video, you will be able to:

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,830
Discuss software versions on computing platforms,

3
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,800
And identify software versions and numbering.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,920
Software versions tell us a lot about programs and applications.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,270
Users can determine what software version they are using, and developers can provide

6
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,969
useful information with version numbers.

7
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,059
Software version numbers vary in length and meaning; however, most version numbers follow

8
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:42,460
a similar format and represent similar information.

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,109
Version numbers indicate when the software was released, when it was updated, and if

10
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:51,370
any minor changes or patches were made to the software.

11
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,630
Software versioning is how software developers keep track of new software, updates, and patches

12
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,850
for programs and applications.

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,350
Version numbers can be displayed in several ways.

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,830
Version numbers can be short or long, depending on the software and the preference of the

15
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,470
developer, with 2, 3, or 4 number sets.

16
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,829
Each number set is divided by a period.

17
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:20,369
The first release of an application or program might have a 1.0 as the version number to

18
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,040
indicate no updates, patches, or fixes to the software.

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,950
Note: A version still in beta or testing could have a version number lower than 1, such as

20
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,939
0.9.

21
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:39,119
A program or application with many releases and updates will have a longer number, sometimes

22
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,149
4 different number sets within the version number

23
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:45,690
Some software developers may use dates for their versioning.

24
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:53,759
For example: Ubuntu Linux version 18.04.2 was released in 2018 April.

25
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,170
The third number set, point-2, designates an additional change or update.

26
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,270
What do these numbers mean?

27
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:07,259
Some version numbers follow the semantic numbering system and have 4 parts separated by a period,

28
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,280
but not all numbering systems follow this 4-part example.

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,120
In semantic numbering , the first number indicates major changes to the software, such as a new

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
release.

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,390
The second number indicates that minor changes were made to the software.

32
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,110
The third number in the version number indicates patches or minor bug fixes.

33
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,540
Finally, the fourth number indicates a build number or a build date, and it can indicate

34
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,819
less significant changes made.

35
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,940
Software version numbers are identified in the About or Help section of software.

36
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,110
You can practice identifying your version number in a web browser.

37
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,790
This example illustrates how to view the version number in the Google Chrome desktop web browser;

38
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,910
however, if you are using a different web browser, you should be able to follow the

39
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,400
same or similar steps.

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,310
To view the browser version:

41
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,650
First, select the three dots or three lines in the top-right corner of your browser.

42
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,239
Next, select the menu item “Help.”

43
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,930
Then, select “About” to view the version information.

44
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,569
The version of your web browser will display.

45
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,350
Are newer versions of software compatible with older versions?

46
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,660
Lack of compatibility between old and new versions of software is a common problem.

47
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,980
You can troubleshoot compatibility issues by viewing the software version to determine

48
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,410
if you are using an outdated version of the software.

49
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,540
Sometimes updating software to a newer version will resolve compatibility issues.

50
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,510
Some software is backwards compatible.

51
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:46,220
If a program or application is backwards compatible, then the older versions of files, programs,

52
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:51,120
and systems will work properly with newer versions.

53
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,510
In this video, you learned that:

54
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:59,120
Version numbers indicate the history of changes, updates, and patches to software,

55
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,420
Some version numbers follow the semantic numbering system and have 4 parts separated by a period,

56
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,219
Compatibility with old and new versions of software is a common problem,

57
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:19,070
and you should view the version of the software you are using to determine software compatibility.
