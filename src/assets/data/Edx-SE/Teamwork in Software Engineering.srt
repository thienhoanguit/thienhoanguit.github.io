Welcome to Insiders' Viewpoints: Teamwork in Software Engineering.

1
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:16,660
In this video, we will hear from experts discussing how teamwork is important in software development,

2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,090
and how teams work together.

3
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,790
Yeah, so teamwork is very, very important in the world of software development.

4
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,070
As a software engineer, you're not just going to be sitting at your desk coding all day.

5
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,750
One of the most important aspects of working on a team or on an engineering team is communication,

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,030
and knowing how to collaborate and speak with your team members about the code you've written,

7
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,339
especially if you're going to a UX designer, and say, Hey, here's what I can do.

8
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,329
And your spec is a bit off.

9
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:56,030
Can we massage your your specs a bit just so we can meet the code coding requirements.

10
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:04,500
Incredibly important, I while I think it's possible for a single person to engineer and

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:12,410
deploy and run software, I, I think doing it as a team is both more impactful and gets

12
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:17,460
you more potential to do bigger and greater things, I think it's also just a more fulfilling

13
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:25,780
process, when you're when you're, you're building something with a group of individuals, I think,

14
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,460
you know, with without the support structure, it's hard to build something and support it

15
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,820
and maintain it just by yourself.

16
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,950
So teamwork, to me, is essential, because we're talking to each other all day.

17
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,680
And we're not only talking to our tech leads or senior engineer, we're talking to product

18
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,610
managers, we're talking to UX designers, we're talking to business analysts, we're talking

19
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,590
to data analysts, and so on and so forth.

20
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,270
You have the support system, you have diversity of opinions and perspectives in terms of how

21
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,630
you go about building it, it's more satisfying, you kind of can take larger risks, because

22
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,870
you're, you're in it together, and you're there to support each other, I think the celebration

23
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:10,530
of of a job well done is is a lot more, you know, it's a lot more fulfilling when you're

24
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,690
when you're doing that with someone else.

25
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:17,129
But I think it just gives you both kind of a larger range of scope and a larger sort

26
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:23,379
of risk portfolio, if you will, and you're able to, I think just, you know, get a lot

27
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:29,269
more done a lot more checks and balances and really gives you you know, less likely, there's

28
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:33,209
a less likely chance that you're gonna miss something, or you're gonna make a mistake,

29
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,709
there's a lot of a lot of support there.

30
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:43,000
And so every project I've worked on has had at least three other people that I have needed

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,069
to communicate with and support to be a reliable resource for them to go to them for questions.

32
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,459
Like I always have to be talking to somebody about something.

33
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,549
So teamwork is crucial.

34
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:03,989
Like, you can't, you can't work in an isolated silo forever, at some point, you have to talk

35
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:05,730
to someone else.

36
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,779
Building a project product takes a lot of people, a lot of us come together to make

37
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:15,569
a whole and to get the product shipped to production so our users can use it.

38
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:19,510
And so teamwork is imperative.
