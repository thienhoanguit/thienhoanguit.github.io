Welcome to Meet the Experts.

1
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:12,860

00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,870
Letâ€™s meet these experts and learn about where they work and what they do.

4
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,540

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,603
And I work directly through Bandwidth, I am not self employed as like a contractor with

14
00:00:57,603 --> 00:00:58,345
them.

15
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:00,640
Hi, my name is Zubin Pratap.

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,190
I'm a software engineer

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,750
and currently I'm a developer advocate at a Web3 startup

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,890
My name is Daniel Rudnitski, and I'm a software engineer at IBM.

19
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,360
My name is James Reeve and I'm a full stack software engineer at IBM.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,470
Hi my name is Rupinder and I work as a Chief Solutions Architect at Skillup Technologies.

21
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:26,170
Hello, everyone, my name is Upkar Lidder and I'm a developer advocate with IBM.

22
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,320
Hi, I'm Yann Stoneham.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,459
I'm a solution architect at Smartronics.

24
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,310
Now, lets listen to some of these experts describe

25
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,410
a little more in detail about what they do.

26
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,870
Yes, so, a developer advocate is a software engineer

27
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,600
who enables developer to be successful with

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
a product.

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,190
That was a mouthful.

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,420
So, essentially, what that means is, for example, at GitHub, I create a lot of content.

31
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,910
So I will do blog posts, workshops, go to conferences to speak about GitHub, the product,

32
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:02,660
will also showcase developers in the open source community, and to like,

33
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,420
give publicity to the projects that they're working on.

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,610
And being an advocate means that I'm able to communicate deeply about technical concepts

35
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,610
in a way that's digestible for engineers across experience level to understand.

36
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,239
Before I was an advocate, I worked as a software engineer in the finance sector

37
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,530
for two years.

38
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,719
I spent a majority of my time coding, I primarily worked on the front end

39
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,390
of the application, using tools such as Git, Docker, GraphQL, React, JavaScript, and the

40
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,959
very few times I would go into the back end,

41
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,849
we use Node js on our back end to make changes and updates.

42
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:47,819
My experience as a software engineer, and also as a technical content creator, paved

43
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,819
the way for me to become a developer advocate at GitHub today.

44
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,010
I'm a software engineer right now.

45
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,280
I'm still pretty Junior.

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,370
So most of my tasks involve creating new features, fixing bugs, and addressing any customer concerns

47
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,349
that we have with, that they have with the current software.

48
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:08,889
Yeah, so, I work on a suite of products that are

49
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:15,560
they're targeted to large content creators, video publishers, customers, such as ESPN,

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,703
Disney, etc.

51
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:24,019
We basically have suites of tools to help them monetize their video content, help them

52
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:29,379
distribute it, help them target it appropriately, report on it, troubleshoot it, for across

53
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,269
all devices, all surfaces.

54
00:03:31,763 --> 00:03:37,819
So it's kind of the full suite of products, starts with the user interfaces that their

55
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:43,730
sales teams and trafficking teams use to sell the ad space,

56
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,739
upload the creatives, the advertisements, and, you know, target them to their audiences

57
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:54,019
and contextually to the content that they're, that they create.

58
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:55,290
We offer reporting on that.

59
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,110
So, a lot of its performance and various other analytics, reach analytics, and so forth.

60
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,700
Previously, before this, I was a software engineer at Google.

61
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,790
And before that, I was a software engineer at a small startup.

62
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,519
But before that, for about over 15 years, I

63
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,670
was a corporate lawyer, and then a business

64
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,409
executive for a while and even had my own startup in the middle.

65
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:16,950
So yeah, very diverse background.

66
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,560
And I taught myself to code in my very late 30s.

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,199
When my startup started to fail, and I really needed to keep it going, and my tech co founder

68
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,199
quit.

69
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,199
So that's what I do.

70
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,199
That's who I am today.

71
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,819
I as a developer advocate, I not only write code, I also produce a lot of educational

72
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:39,130
content, and material that is useful for people to onboard onto Web3 and other technologies.

73
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,690
And my role is really to help connect the product team with the actual developer ecosystem.

74
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,561
Bring the two together through code content, education and community.
